# Pull Reminder

A browser extension which was designed to reminder people to review GitHub Pull Requests. Inspired from Arc Browser's Github Pull Folder which instantly adds a tab to the sidebar folder when it is raised or a draft is converted to ready for review.

## Learnings

- Needed faster development pace. Build the major part of it during a weekend or so. Use cursor like ai code editor where and when required.
- VueJS is easy and fun to implement. However if you are going to build a serious project with a new tech stack or core framework, use atleast the entire week to learn it and not the weekend where you are going to develop and build the project.
- For this we used a command line ai editor like aider which does not seem as helpful as thought. In-editor ai editors are better.
- Dealing with a new library (like unocss in this case) was problematic because it ate up product building time and it went in bug solving. Though it was solvable and unocss seems better than tailwind, time is higher priority during a weekend project.
